## Installation

To install first create a build directory in `src` using:

  `mkdir build`
  
Then move to it and build the project using cmake:

  `cmake ../` and then
  `make`

If you are using linux, [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML) requires you to install **some [dependencies](#dependencies)**.
You can download them with your chosen package manager (eg: *apt*) - all common package managers should be fine.


## Dependencies

This project uses [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML). CMake will handle the installation of that for you, but you are required to install a few small SFML dependencies. These can be found [here](https://github.com/SFML/SFML#external-libraries-used-by-sfml).
